>   sudo apt-get update
>   sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev
>   ```
> - **macOS**:
>   ```bash
>   brew install openssl
>   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
>   export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"

## **Usage**

### 1. **Login**
- Use the master password (`admin123` by default) to log in.
- In production, replace the hardcoded master password with an environment variable for enhanced security.

### 2. **Dashboard**
- View app features and instructions on the dashboard.

### 3. **Store Data**
- Enter a unique label (e.g., "Bank Credentials").
- Provide sensitive data in the text area.
- Create a strong passkey (minimum 8 characters, including special characters).
- Click **"Encrypt & Store"** to securely save your data.

### 4. **Retrieve Data**
- Enter the label and passkey used during storage.
- Click **"Decrypt Data"** to retrieve and view the decrypted content.

### 5. **Logout**
- Log out securely from the sidebar menu.

## **Security Notes**
- **Master Password**: Replace the default `MASTER_PASS` in the code with an environment variable for production use.
- **Encryption Key**: The encryption key is stored in `secret.key`. Ensure this file is secured and not exposed publicly.
- **Stored Data**: Encrypted data is stored in `data.json`. Keep this file secure as it contains sensitive information.
